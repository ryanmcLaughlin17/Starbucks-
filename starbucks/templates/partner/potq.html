    <p class="potq_fact">- Niamh over the last quarter has been a woman on a mission! Opening a new store with an almost entirely new team brings a great deal of pressure, but she seems to have relished the challenge and the success which has followed, Niamh has been pivotal in achieving it. She leads her shifts with a great deal of confidence and professionalism, promotes a fun, but hard-working environment and never fails to ensure that partners and customers are feeling supported. She is dependable and the team have said that she is always there to have their backs if any issues arise. Whilst running shifts, Niamh has displayed a unique adaptability to any issues which have came her way and the way she deals with them and remains so cool headed and driven is testament to her character and, without doubt, she would be a great addition to any team. Niamh is also our store coffee master and she truly encapulates the coffee passion which Starbucks strives for. Whether it's coaching partners on beverage quality, delivering amazing coffee tastings or making sure we are all prepared for new beverages being released, Niamh makes sure that our coffee culture is always being looked after and that we have the tools to deliver such consistent and high standards on a daily basis. She truly does create that culture of warmth and belonging and I firmly believe she is one for the future and if she pursued progression in the company I have no doubts that she would succeed.
